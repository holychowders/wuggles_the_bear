### FIXME

- Ghost Wuggles is invisible (probably due to a bug rather than a lack of art)!
- Some speech strings don't work

### TODO

- Art
  - Wuggles needs a face, body, animations, icons, etc
  - Wuggles needs art for their custom items

- Speech
  - Wuggles needs to express their personality through speech strings (`scripts/speech_wuggles.lua`)
